// CSCN 112 Participation Lab #1
// Learning how to create class objects, header files, and implementation files 

/*
	INSTRUCTIONS

	Learning Objectives
	 - Practice proper programming form
	 - Demonstrate the ability to work in a group
	 - Learn how to successfully create a class using header and implementation files
	 - Implement class objects and use them in a program successfully

	 Overview: Your team is starting up a new bakery (you may be creative with your bakery name). You need to create a program that will automate
	   the ordering system, allowing your patrons to purchase various items from the menu before printing out an overall total. This system will
	   be created through several labs throughout the semester, but your initial goal is to be able to create menu items. Use the following steps
	   to guide your process:

	 1.)  Create your header and implementation files for a class named menuItem
	 2.)  The menuItem class should be used to store the name of the item, the price of the item, and how many of that specific item has been ordered
	 3.)  Your class should include appropriate functions - accessor and mutator functions and a print function
	 4.)  In main, confirm that you can create an object of the menuItem class, then create an array of menuItem objects called menu
	 5.)  Next, you need to be able to bring in the various items that your bakery is going to sell (using a text file and function(s))
			- Hint: Start by creating a function that can bring in a SINGLE item from a file, then expand to bring in more than one item
	 6.)  Create a function that prints off the menu
